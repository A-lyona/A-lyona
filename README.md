### The game of tic-tac-toe takes place on a square field of 3 by 3 cells (the size of the playing field may be different). When clicking on the cells of the playing field, the first move always puts a cross, the next zero, and so on in turn. The goal of the game is to line up three identical pieces vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
