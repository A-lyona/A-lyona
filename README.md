### The application is a quiz on cartoons, films, TV shows. When loading the game, all questions are randomly selected. If the player gave the correct answer on the first attempt, his score increases by 5 points, each next attempt gives one point less, if the correct answer is given only on the last, sixth attempt, the player receives 0 points for it. When the player has given the correct answer, he gets the opportunity to move on to the next question. After the last question, a page with the results of the game is displayed.
